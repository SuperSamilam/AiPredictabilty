Thank you for downloading this project. 

I think this is a very intresting project that can be built on to make it even better.
And im not sure what it really means being able to predict humans but it is defently intresting.

In this github repo do have the model I used for testing so you can test it too. 
It should return the same result given the same data witch i have included in the TestResults file. 
This project is really just a cleaned up version of the real project that have another resporotary. 
But this does have everything nessecary. 

*YOU WILL NEED TO CHANGE THE FILE PATHS IN THE CODE*

The file called AIGuessGame is the version humans enter in a number series and the AI guesses
HumanGuessGame is the version where the humans guess on the eailer created number series

Theese files only get the basic data from the guesses. Therefore i have the RunTestForMoreData 
witch can get more data that can be considered intresting.

BUG
Curretnly there is a bug where the result acully return -2 one time, Im not sure why but be aware
